Some states have already begun relaxing some Coronavirus lockdown conditions and allowing more shops to open. Following Friday nightâ€™s order by the Union Home Ministry, states are opening more categories of shops, including those selling garments, mobile phones, hardware, and stationery items. These relaxations though would not be allowed for shops located in market places, malls, and COVID-19 hotspots and containment zones. In rural areas, all shops barring those in malls have been allowed to open. Liquor and cigarette shops would remain closed everywhere irrespective of their location, while the sale of non-essential items through e-commerce platforms continues to remain shut. Restaurants, hair salons, and barbershops will not be allowed to open as these render services and do not fall under the shop category.
Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta has changed his name on his badge to 'Harjeet Singh' for today, in support of ASI Harjeeet Singh whose hand was dismembered in an attack in Patiala on April 12 during Coronavirus lockdown. He said, "Harjeet Singh has become a symbol against attacks on police and other frontline workers".
